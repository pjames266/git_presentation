## What are README.md files?

readme files are very important files that give a summary of what is in a repository and what someone should know when looking at the repository. These files are speacially setup in repositories to display below the main repository directory. Readme files are written in Markdown (.md). This is a script markup language for text formatting using a simple text editor.

other markdown files can be added to your repositories to ack as notes or instructions.
